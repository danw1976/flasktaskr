Task management system

Users can sign in and out from the landing page
New users can register on a separate registration page
Once signed in, users can add new tasks (each task consists of a name, due date, priority, status, and a unique ID)
Users can view all incomplete tasks from the same page
Users can also delete tasks and mark tasks as complete (deleted tasks will be removed from the database)
